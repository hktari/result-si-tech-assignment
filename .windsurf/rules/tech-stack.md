### Guidelines for REACT


#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Guidelines for NODE

#### NEST

- Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability following SOLID principles
- Implement custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns to keep code DRY and maintain separation of business logic
- Use interceptors for transforming the response data structure consistently for {{api_standards}}
- Leverage NestJS Guards for authorization to centralize access control logic across {{protected_resources}}
- Implement domain-driven design with modules that encapsulate related functionality and maintain clear boundaries
- Use TypeORM or Mongoose with repository patterns to abstract database operations and simplify testing with mocks

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to NestJS

### Testing

- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.
